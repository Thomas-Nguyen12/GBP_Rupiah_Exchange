# Forecasting British GBP to Indonesian Rupiah Exchange Rates

## Project Description 
Many international students constantly check exchange rates when withdrawing their allowances. This requires persistant back and forth checking between local websites and the memory
to do so. As such, international students are constantly distracted from their studies and are unaware of key dates to check. 
This project aims to help international students predict key dates between the British pound (GBP) and the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). As such, they can focus on their studies and
understand how exchange rates have changed over time.
